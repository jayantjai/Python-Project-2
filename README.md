Key Achievements / Resume Points:

Data Creation & Manipulation

Created and managed structured datasets using Pandas DataFrames.

Practiced selecting, filtering, and indexing data efficiently with .loc[] and .iloc[].

Added new computed columns like Designation to enrich dataset features.

Missing Data Handling

Detected missing values using isna(), sum(), and any() functions.

Applied multiple strategies for missing value treatment:

Deletion: Removed rows with excessive nulls using dropna() and thresh parameter.

Imputation: Replaced missing values using constant values, dictionaries, and column-wise means.

Improved dataset quality and ensured consistency for analysis.

Data Integration

Performed inner, left, and outer joins using pd.merge() to combine employee and salary datasets.

Understood and resolved mismatched keys and missing join cases during merging operations.

Data Concatenation

Combined multiple datasets vertically and horizontally using pd.concat() to create unified datasets.

Practical Understanding

Built a clear understanding of the data cleaning lifecycle — identifying, handling, and validating missing or inconsistent data.

Ensured dataset readiness for further analysis or model training.
